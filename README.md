# To-Do List App

This project is a simple To-Do List App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The app allows users to add tasks to their to-do list, mark them as completed, and clear them when desired. It uses the user's internal storage (localStorage) to save the to-do list data so that tasks persist even after refreshing or closing the browser, until the user clears them manually.
